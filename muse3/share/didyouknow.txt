MusE can add effects in realtime for audio tracks,<br>check the effect rack on the mixer strip

For routing and selection dialogs that allow multiple selections<br>use ctrl when clicking to keep the dialog open

MusE can use Windows VST synths if the dssi-vst bridge is installed!

If you regularly make the same type of connections you can make a<br> template-project with all of your basic settings already prewired.<br>Just store the song as a template using the project dialog.

It's possible to create midi filters or generators in any<br>language, see instructions and examples under <br>muse2/share/scripts in the source.

Click on the automation column in the track list to make<br>automation lines visible for a parameter.

Adding effects will add more automatable parameters to the<br>automation column.

Most functions in MusE are reachable from the keyboard.<br>See 'Configure Shortcuts' under 'MusE Settings'.<br>For instance: A - pointer, D - draw, R - erase, S - cut.

Midi parts can be cloned. All clone parts contain the same data,<br>change one and all will be changed.

Parts can be copied and deleted using the standard cut/copy/paste<br>but it is also possible to click and drag parts to duplicate.<br>ctrl+click+drag to duplicate parts<br>ctrl+alt+click+drag to create clones

When using the dark theme, make sure to select Qt theme plastique<br>or the theme will not be consistent.

If it's hard to be precise while moving automation points with the mouse, trying holding the SHIFT key, the movement will be slower.

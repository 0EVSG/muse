         - Update all libs to latest versions. (Tim)
         * Steps to update the built-in lv2 support library versions:
           (A guide really,Â new versions may deprecate things or need new tweaks):
           1: Bring (copy) all the new versions' folders to lv2Support folder.
           2: Delete all unnecessary text files and build scripts etc, and doc, 
               bindings, test, utils folders etc, also the lv2/lv2plug.in/ns/meta 
               folder and index.html.in We want just all the lib c/h files.
           3: Comment out all #include "sord_config.h", #include "serd_config.h" 
               and #include "lilv_config.h" since WE supply those config values.
           4: Apply the fix of 24.03.2016 if desired.
           5: Be sure to change the hard-coded lv2, lilv, serd, sord and sratom
               built-in version numbers, in the top-level cmakelists.txt,
               so that cmake can find these newly added versions.
           6: Delete the old versions' folders.
           7: Remember to remove/add folders from/to the git repo.

         - Changed lilv/lib.c: lilv_lib_open(): Added RTLD_DEEPBIND to dlopen() call. (Tim)
           Fixes at least two Qt4 external-ui synths (synthv1, drumk) crashing.
           Could not find any more such plugins to test.
           See the corresponding ui dlopen call in LV2Synth::lv2ui_ShowNativeGui() 
            for a similar fix and test results.

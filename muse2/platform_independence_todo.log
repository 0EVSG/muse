Making MusE portable TODO

2015-02-10
- MusE compiles on OSX!!
2015-02-09
- Moved gui.cpp to use signals instead of a pipe, can't be an issue.
- QProcess for launching external sound editor
- removed mmap usage
- changed lots of memory alignment code to alloc_align

2015-02-05
- Added new timers QtTimer and SimpleTimer to make muse work without Alsa or Rtc
- Made ALSA optional

2015-02-04
- Moved libuuid to QUuid
- Test cloning with QUuid - seems OK

2015-02-02
- Moved fluidsynth to QThread and QMutexLocker
- Moved simpledrums to QThread and QMutexLocker
- Moved Thread to QThread
- Moved DummyAudio to QThread

TODO
- Fixup _LINUX_TEST_ in Thread, it only shows that it works without these Linux/Posix optimizations right now
- Fixup _LINUX_TEST_ in DummyAudio also
- Fix all.h all-pic.h copying
- Look out for more _LINUX_TEST_ with file descriptors that must be replaced
- test drag&drop in canvas

checkout QLibrary as replacement for dlsym etc..

FIXED:
- Fix gui.cpp commented pipe, implemented as signal
- 2543 pcanvas.cpp exchange mmap trickery with QMimeData *mimeData =  MusECore::file_to_mimedata(tmp, mimeString );
   and remove mmap implementation from it.

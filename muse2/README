      - DSSI     Disposable Soft Synth Interface (development files)   
          http://dssi.sourceforge.net/
        (Both recommended - DSSI needs OSC, OSC alone does nothing, for now.)

      - dssi-vst        Support for DSSI vst plugins            
          http://www.breakfastquay.com/dssi-vst/

          http://lash.nongnu.org/
          Recently LADISH has been emulating it instead:         
          http://ladish.org/
      
      - Python		The python scripting language
          http://www.python.org
          Python support is required for some experimental features.
          Currently it's NOT recommended to build with python support.

      - PyQt4 is used by some of the bundled midi scripts

  =============================
      Building MusE:
  =============================

      - Download source from http://muse-sequencer.org/

      - Unpack the source somewhere.  

        You may also try the various MusE development GIT branches for
         up-to-the-minute features and fixes, but they may be less stable. 

      - To compile MusE, run the following commands from the 
         top level directory where the source code was unpacked
         (the directory where THIS README FILE is found): 
       
	******************************************************
        *                      Notice:                       *
        * A quick way is to run the ./compile_muse.sh        *
        * script in the same dir, it should perform the same *
        * steps for a basic setup without asking any         *
        * questions. If it fails you may be better off using *
        * the instructions below.                            *
        ******************************************************
 
        The build directory:
        --------------------
          Building in a subdirectory is recommended to keep the build directory separate from the source tree. 
          So create a new subdirectory with a useful name like "build" or "debug" or "release": 
            mkdir build
          Change directory (cd) to the new directory: 
            cd build  

        Configuration:
        --------------
          There are a few different ways to configure (notice the two dots):

          Type "cmake -i .." to run in step-by-step 'Wizard' mode, this is the RECOMMENDED way to
          setup the build environment.

          Or type "cmake -L .." to see options, then compose "cmake <options>" yourself. 
          Some <options> are:

            -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<type>
               <type> can be blank (to reset a previous cached type to 'empty'), 
                debug, release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel.
               Release is recommended, to get optimizations.
               If no CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is given at all, cmake uses either the previous 
                cached value, or else 'empty' (plain or default system optimizations).

            -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>
               The installation <prefix> where the program is installed.
               The default is to install in /usr/local.

          Or type "ccmake .." (if you have it - text-mode GUI). It may be blank so hit  
           'C' to first-time configure. Fiddle with yer options if ye so desire, then hit 
           'C' to configure then 'G' to generate and exit, or 'Q' to quit without 
           generating. 

          Or there is also a desktop GUI for cmake called cmake-gui.

        Compiling:
        ----------  
          After configuration, while still in the build directory,type:
            make 

        Installing:
        ----------  
          After compiling, type:
            make install (as root) 
           or
            sudo make install

  =============================
      Running MusE:
  =============================

      Recommended setup:
      ------------------
        MusE is a realtime program which requires special rights to work properly.

      - Check if you are running a sufficiently new linux kernel > 2.6.x
        A modern, standard destop kernel might suit your needs.
        However, for the best performance a so-called 'low latency' or 'realtime' 
         kernel may be required. Check your distro's packages for availability. 

      - create an "audio" group if it does not already exists
        and put yourself into this group

      - For realtime priority, you may want to ensure either the file:
           /etc/security/limits.conf
         or
           /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf
         contains:
           @audio   -  rtprio     95
           @audio   -  memlock    unlimited

      - make sure you can acces the realtime clock (RTC)
            chmod 660 /dev/rtc
            chgrp audio /dev/rtc

      - make sure MusE can set the rtc clock:
            echo 8192 > /proc/sys/dev/rtc/max-user-freq
            inspect with:
            cat /proc/sys/dev/rtc/max-user-freq

      - some distros do not load the alsa sequencer module by default.
        if necessary, load the alsa sequencer module with:
            /sbin/modprobe snd-seq

      - Start jack, typically by using the qjackctl application.
        MusE can also be run without Jack. MusE will use a dummy audio 
         driver if Jack is not detected, or the -a option is given.


      Running:
      ------------------
        start MusE by typing:
            muse2 <options>

          Some <options> are (complete list is printed by running muse2 -h):
            -h       help
            -v       print version
            -d       debug mode: no threads, no RT
            -D       debug mode: enable some debug messages
                                  specify twice for lots of debug messages
                                  this may slow down MusE massively!
            -m       debug mode: trace midi Input
            -M       debug mode: trace midi Output
            -s       debug mode: trace sync
            -a       no audio
            -A       Force inclusion of ALSA midi even if using Jack
            -P  n    set audio driver real time priority to n
                      (Dummy only, default 40. Else fixed by Jack.)
            -Y  n    force midi real time priority to n (default: audio driver prio +2)
            -p       don't load LADSPA plugins
            -I       don't load DSSI plugins
            -L       don't use LASH
            -l  xx   force locale to the given language/country code
                      (xx = de,en,es,fr,pl,ru,sv_SE)

      (JACK and all its clients (qjackctl & MusE) must run with the
      same user id)


  =============================
      known bugs
  =============================

      The odd wierdness happens and some things may not be completely implemeneted
      though we hope it is as stable for you as it is for us!

      If you differ in this opinion we are grateful for all reported issues.

      See the bug tracker for a better view of issues
